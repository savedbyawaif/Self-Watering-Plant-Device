# Self-Watering-Plant-Device
This project is based on trying to relieve any stress from having to look after house plants that need constant care, since improper care can cause these plants to die very quickly. In order to achieve this, we first analyzed what these plants needed in order to be taken care of properly. Assuming these plants are kept in a well lit house, the only factor that the plant needs to survive is sufficient water. Therefore, our project will be based around finding the moisture it is receiving, and if insufficient, we will supplement it to an appropriate amount automatically, and if the source of water is low, we will alert the user to refill the source.
